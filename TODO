Document the electronics side of things
Doesn't pin_ir_reciever_bit=0 mean pin 8 (i.e. the output pin) instead of pin 12.
Add serial read code
Add a fire event handler
Add a trigger button
Add a trigger communication over serial
Add really simple code on the Pi to respond to the trigger being pressed by asking for a shot to be fired.
Code game logic in python

arduino enhancements:
* use another CTC timer to tell when to set the ir up or down (not to be confused with the carrier frequency!)
* In signal_recieve should we check that we have been low for an appropriate amount of time?
