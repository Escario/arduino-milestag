why doesn't the UI work for more then 2 players /team?
  Can we just use a table instead of a list?

reset mechanism
mumble
test drag and drop ui
team number slider - numbers and a label
battery checker
exit the Read and Write threads cleanly.
use a widget for the player display
sensible column widths
hide the acellerator keys for the tabs.
Why do I get Broken pipes when moving players around?
largestTeam and teamCount should go up as well as down.
