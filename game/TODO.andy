why doesn't the UI work for more then 2 players /team?
  Can we just use a table instead of a list?

reset mechanism
mumble
drag and drop ui
team number slider - numbers and a label
battery checker
column widths
exit the Read and Write threads cleanly.
use a widget for the player display
accellerator keys for the tabs.
